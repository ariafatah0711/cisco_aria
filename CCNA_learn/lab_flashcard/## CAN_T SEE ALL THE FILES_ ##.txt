Hello!

I sometimes get messages saying "Where are the rest of the files? I can only see up to Day 28". 
All of the lab files are in this Drive, but if you're having trouble seeing them, try this:
1) Open the Drive in another browser
and/or
2) Log in to Google (if you aren't logged in)

That should allow you to see all of the files!
