# **CCNA Studies Repository**

Welcome to the CCNA Studies repository! This repository contains .pka files (Packet Tracer Activity) from my CCNA studies, where I've been learning about Cisco networking concepts and protocols. Please note that the uploaded files are the original .pka activities that I solved when I was learning. I have completed each of them successfully, demonstrating the ability to solve and build the included configurations.

Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is an entry-level certification offered by Cisco Systems, one of the world's leading networking equipment providers. The CCNA certification validates your ability to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot small to medium-sized networks.

__note: exercises may overlap, for example: eigrp pka may contain VLAN, DHCP, ACL, etc 

# **Repository Contents**

In this repository, you'll find a collection of .pka files corresponding to various networking activities I completed during my CCNA studies. Each .pka file represents a different scenario, such as setting up a basic network, implementing VLANs, configuring routing protocols, and more.

Please note that I could not recover .pka files for the very basic setups, like basic VLANs and setting up 2 PCs, but I had completed those too in the past.

# **Disclaimer**

Please note that while these .pka files are based on real CCNA course activities, they are not official Cisco materials. Use them for educational purposes and self-study to reinforce your networking skills.

+most of them are written in hungarian
